        <p class="mb-8 p-5 text-center">I care about how to improve every aspect of our life by the use of technology and programming languages, be it education, business or lifestyle. If you are a CS student or a working professional, you need to catch the industry pulse and must have core concepts of programming to build your career and grow with it. Now every other day there is a new update in programming languages or new frameworks are in requirement and if you have the in depth knowledge of the core of that programming language, then it will be much more faster & easier to adopt those things. If you are running a business then in this digital age your business needs online presence in order to connect with your audiences and somehow you also need to know about how you can leverage technology to make it more beneficial for your business.</p>
